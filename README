CDBEasy
===========

A Simple module to help reading and writing CDB files in php. 

Limitation :
1) We can open CDB files in either to read or write mode. We can't update values in CDB file. CDBEasy has wrapper function to do      these operation.
2) One CDB file can be max of 4 GB length. It is due to it's Hashing algorithm.
